  - model_name: asNumber
    type: Int64
    description: An Autonomous System Number (ASN) is required if you are to run BGP and peer with another BGP Speaker outside of the Auto VPN domain. This ASN will be applied to the entire Auto VPN domain. The entire 4-byte ASN range is supported. So, the ASN must be an integer between 1 and 4294967295. When absent, this field is not updated. If no value exists then it defaults to 64512.
    example: "64515"
  - model_name: enabled
    type: Bool
    mandatory: true
    description: Boolean value to enable or disable the BGP configuration. When BGP is enabled, the asNumber (ASN) will be autopopulated with the preconfigured ASN at other Hubs or a default value if there is no ASN configured.
    example: "true"
  - model_name: ibgpHoldTimer
    type: Int64
    description: The iBGP holdtimer in seconds. The iBGP holdtimer must be an integer between 12 and 240. When absent, this field is not updated. If no value exists then it defaults to 240.
    example: "120"
  - model_name: neighbors
    type: List
    description: List of BGP neighbors. This list replaces the existing set of neighbors. When absent, this field is not updated.
    attributes:

        type: Bool
        description: When this feature is on, the Meraki device will advertise routes learned from other Autonomous Systems, thereby allowing traffic between Autonomous Systems to transit this AS. When absent, it defaults to false.

      - model_name: ebgpHoldTimer
        type: Int64
        mandatory: true
        description: The eBGP hold timer in seconds for each neighbor. The eBGP hold timer must be an integer between 12 and 240.

      - model_name: multiExitDiscriminator
        type: Int64
        description: Configures the local metric associated with routes received from the remote peer. Routes from peers with lower metrics are will be preferred. Must be an integer between 0 and 4294967295. MED is 6th in the decision tree when identical routes from multiple peers exist.
        example: "2"
      - model_name: nextHopIp

      - model_name: receiveLimit
        type: Int64
        description: The receive limit is the maximum number of routes that can be received from any BGP peer. The receive limit must be an integer between 0 and 2147483647. When absent, it defaults to 0.
        example: "120"
      - model_name: remoteAsNumber
        type: Int64
        mandatory: true
        description: Remote ASN of the neighbor. The remote ASN must be an integer between 1 and 4294967295.

        type: String
        description: 'The output interface for peering with the remote BGP peer. Valid values are: `wan1`, `wan2` or `vlan{VLAN ID}`(e.g. `vlan123`).'
        example: wan1

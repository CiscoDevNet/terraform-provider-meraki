In Terraform v1.12.0 and later, the [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) can be used with the `identity` attribute, for example:

```terraform
import {
  to = meraki_switch_routing_static_route.example
  identity = {
    "serial" : "<serial>"
    "id" : "<id>"
  }
}
```

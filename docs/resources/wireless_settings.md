# meraki_wireless_settings (Resource)

This resource can manage the `Wireless settings` configuration.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "meraki_wireless_settings" "example" {
  network_id                                = "L_123456"
  ipv6_bridge_enabled                       = true
  led_lights_on                             = true
  location_analytics_enabled                = false
  meshing_enabled                           = true
  upgrade_strategy                          = "minimizeUpgradeTime"
  named_vlans_pool_dhcp_monitoring_duration = 5
  named_vlans_pool_dhcp_monitoring_enabled  = false
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `network_id` (String) Network ID

### Optional

- `ipv6_bridge_enabled` (Boolean) Toggle for enabling or disabling IPv6 bridging in a network (Note: if enabled, SSIDs must also be configured to use bridge mode)
- `led_lights_on` (Boolean) Toggle for enabling or disabling LED lights on all APs in the network (making them run dark)
- `location_analytics_enabled` (Boolean) Toggle for enabling or disabling location analytics for your network
- `meshing_enabled` (Boolean) Toggle for enabling or disabling meshing in a network
- `named_vlans_pool_dhcp_monitoring_duration` (Number) The duration in minutes that devices will refrain from using dirty VLANs before adding them back to the pool.
- `named_vlans_pool_dhcp_monitoring_enabled` (Boolean) Whether or not devices using named VLAN pools should remove dirty VLANs from the pool, thereby preventing clients from being assigned to VLANs where they would be unable to obtain an IP address via DHCP.
- `upgrade_strategy` (String) The default strategy that network devices will use to perform an upgrade. Requires firmware version MR 26.8 or higher.
  - Choices: `minimizeClientDowntime`, `minimizeUpgradeTime`

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The id of the object

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

In Terraform v1.12.0 and later, the [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) can be used with the `identity` attribute, for example:

```terraform
import {
  to = meraki_wireless_settings.example
  identity = {
    "network_id" : "<network_id>"
  }
}
```

### Identity Schema

#### Required

- `network_id` (String) Network ID

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, the [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) can be used with the `id` attribute, for example:

```terraform
import {
  to = meraki_wireless_settings.example
  id = "<network_id>"
}
```

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:

```shell
terraform import meraki_wireless_settings.example "<network_id>"
```

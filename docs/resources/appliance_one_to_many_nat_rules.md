# meraki_appliance_one_to_many_nat_rules (Resource)

This resource can manage the `Appliance One To Many NAT Rules` configuration.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "meraki_appliance_one_to_many_nat_rules" "example" {
  network_id = "L_123456"
  rules = [
    {
      public_ip = "146.11.11.13"
      uplink    = "internet1"
      port_rules = [
        {
          local_ip    = "192.168.128.1"
          local_port  = "443"
          name        = "Rule 1"
          protocol    = "tcp"
          public_port = "9443"
          allowed_ips = ["any"]
        }
      ]

## Schema

### Required

- `network_id` (String) Network ID
- `rules` (Attributes List) An array of 1:Many nat rules (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--rules))

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The id of the object

<a id="nestedatt--rules"></a>
### Nested Schema for `rules`

Required:

- `port_rules` (Attributes List) An array of associated forwarding rules (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--rules--port_rules))
- `public_ip` (String) The IP address that will be used to access the internal resource from the WAN
- `uplink` (String) The physical WAN interface on which the traffic will arrive (`internet1` or, if available, `internet2`)
  - Choices: `internet1`, `internet2`

<a id="nestedatt--rules--port_rules"></a>
### Nested Schema for `rules.port_rules`

Required:

- `allowed_ips` (List of String) Remote IP addresses or ranges that are permitted to access the internal resource via this port forwarding rule, or `any`
- `local_ip` (String) Local IP address to which traffic will be forwarded
- `local_port` (String) Destination port of the forwarded traffic that will be sent from the MX to the specified host on the LAN. If you simply wish to forward the traffic without translating the port, this should be the same as the Public port
- `protocol` (String) `tcp` or `udp`
  - Choices: `tcp`, `udp`
- `public_port` (String) Destination port of the traffic that is arriving on the WAN

Optional:

- `name` (String) A description of the rule

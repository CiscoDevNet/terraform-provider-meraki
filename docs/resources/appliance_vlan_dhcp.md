# meraki_appliance_vlan_dhcp (Resource)

This resource is meant to be used in addition to the `meraki_appliance_vlan` resource to configure DHCP settings for a VLAN. It requires the VLAN to be already configured on the appliance.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "meraki_appliance_vlan_dhcp" "example" {
  network_id                = "L_123456"
  vlan_id                   = "1234"
  dhcp_boot_filename        = "sample.file"
  dhcp_boot_next_server     = "1.2.3.4"
  dhcp_boot_options_enabled = true
  dhcp_handling             = "Run a DHCP server"
  dhcp_lease_time           = "1 day"
  dns_nameservers           = "upstream_dns"
  fixed_ip_assignments = {
    "22:33:44:55:66:77" = {
      ip   = "192.168.1.100"
      name = "Some client name"
    }
  }
  mandatory_dhcp_enabled = true
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `network_id` (String) Network ID
- `vlan_id` (String) The VLAN ID of the new VLAN (must be between 1 and 4094)

### Optional

- `dhcp_boot_filename` (String) DHCP boot option for boot filename
- `dhcp_boot_next_server` (String) DHCP boot option to direct boot clients to the server to load the boot file from
- `dhcp_boot_options_enabled` (Boolean) Use DHCP boot options specified in other properties
- `dhcp_handling` (String) The appliance`s handling of DHCP requests on this VLAN. One of: `Run a DHCP server`, `Relay DHCP to another server` or `Do not respond to DHCP requests`
  - Choices: `Do not respond to DHCP requests`, `Relay DHCP to another server`, `Run a DHCP server`
- `dhcp_lease_time` (String) The term of DHCP leases if the appliance is running a DHCP server on this VLAN. One of: `30 minutes`, `1 hour`, `4 hours`, `12 hours`, `1 day` or `1 week`
  - Choices: `1 day`, `1 hour`, `1 week`, `12 hours`, `30 minutes`, `4 hours`
- `dhcp_options` (Attributes List) The list of DHCP options that will be included in DHCP responses. Each object in the list should have 'code', 'type', and 'value' properties. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--dhcp_options))

- `dns_nameservers` (String) The DNS nameservers used for DHCP responses, either 'upstream_dns', 'google_dns', 'opendns', or a newline seperated string of IP addresses or domain names
- `fixed_ip_assignments` (Attributes Map) The DHCP fixed IP assignments on the VLAN. Thekey of this map is a MAC address. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--fixed_ip_assignments))
- `mandatory_dhcp_enabled` (Boolean) Enable Mandatory DHCP on VLAN.
- `reserved_ip_ranges` (Attributes List) The DHCP reserved IP ranges on the VLAN (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--reserved_ip_ranges))
- `vpn_nat_subnet` (String) The translated VPN subnet if VPN and VPN subnet translation are enabled on the VLAN

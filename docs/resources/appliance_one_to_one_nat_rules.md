This resource can manage the `Appliance One To One NAT Rules` configuration.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "meraki_appliance_one_to_one_nat_rules" "example" {
  network_id = "L_123456"
  rules = [
    {
      lan_ip    = "192.168.128.22"
      name      = "Service behind NAT"
      public_ip = "146.12.3.33"
      uplink    = "internet1"
      allowed_inbound = [
        {
          protocol          = "tcp"
          allowed_ips       = ["10.82.112.0/24"]
          destination_ports = ["80"]

This resource can manage the `Appliance Port Forwarding Rules` configuration.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "meraki_appliance_port_forwarding_rules" "example" {
  network_id = "L_123456"
  rules = [
    {
      lan_ip      = "192.168.128.1"
      local_port  = "442-443"
      name        = "Description of Port Forwarding Rule"
      protocol    = "tcp"
      public_port = "8100-8101"
      uplink      = "both"
      allowed_ips = ["any"]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `network_id` (String) Network ID
- `rules` (Attributes List) An array of port forwarding params (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--rules))

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The id of the object

<a id="nestedatt--rules"></a>
### Nested Schema for `rules`

Required:

- `allowed_ips` (List of String) An array of ranges of WAN IP addresses that are allowed to make inbound connections on the specified ports or port ranges (or any)
- `lan_ip` (String) The IP address of the server or device that hosts the internal resource that you wish to make available on the WAN
- `local_port` (String) A port or port ranges that will receive the forwarded traffic from the WAN
- `protocol` (String) TCP or UDP
  - Choices: `tcp`, `udp`
- `public_port` (String) A port or port ranges that will be forwarded to the host on the LAN

Optional:

- `name` (String) A descriptive name for the rule
- `uplink` (String) The physical WAN interface on which the traffic will arrive (`internet1` or, if available, `internet2` or `both`)
  - Choices: `both`, `internet1`, `internet2`

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

In Terraform v1.12.0 and later, the [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) can be used with the `identity` attribute, for example:

```terraform
import {
  to = meraki_appliance_port_forwarding_rules.example
  identity = {
    "network_id" : "<network_id>"
  }
}
```

### Identity Schema

#### Required

- `network_id` (String) Network ID

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, the [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) can be used with the `id` attribute, for example:

```terraform
import {
  to = meraki_appliance_port_forwarding_rules.example
  id = "<network_id>"
}
```

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:

```shell
terraform import meraki_appliance_port_forwarding_rules.example "<network_id>"
```

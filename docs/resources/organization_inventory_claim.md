# meraki_organization_inventory_claim (Resource)

This resource allows claiming and releasing serials from the organization inventory. It will not not touch any existing serials already claimed and not included in `serials`. Licenses and orders can only be claimed but not released.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "meraki_organization_inventory_claim" "example" {
  organization_id = "123456"
  licenses = [
    {
      key  = "Z2XXXXXXXXXX"
      mode = "addDevices"
    }
  ]
  orders  = ["4CXXXXXXX"]
  serials = ["1234-1234-1234"]
}

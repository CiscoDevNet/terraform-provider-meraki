  organization_id = "123456"
  items = [{
    license_id    = "123"
    device_serial = "Q234-ABCD-5678"
  }]
}
```

### Nested Schema for `items`

In Terraform v1.12.0 and later, the [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) can be used with the `identity` attribute, for example:

import {
  to = meraki_organization_licenses.example
  identity = {
    "organization_id" : "<organization_id>"
  }
}
```

<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->

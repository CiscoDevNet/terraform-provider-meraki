# meraki_switch_stack_routing_static_routes (Resource)

This resource can manage the `Switch Stack Routing Static Route` configuration in bulk.

This bulk resource uses the following attributes to uniquely identify each object. Changing any of these attributes will cause the object to be deleted and recreated.

- `next_hop_ip`
- `subnet`

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "meraki_switch_stack_routing_static_routes" "example" {
  network_id      = "L_123456"
  switch_stack_id = "1234"
  organization_id = "123456"
  items = [{
    name        = "My route"
    next_hop_ip = "192.168.1.1"
    subnet      = "192.168.2.0/24"
  }]
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `items` (Attributes Set) The list of items (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--items))
- `network_id` (String) Network ID
- `organization_id` (String) The organization ID
- `switch_stack_id` (String) Switch stack ID

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The id of the object

<a id="nestedatt--items"></a>
### Nested Schema for `items`

Required:

- `next_hop_ip` (String) IP address of the next hop device to which the device sends its traffic for the subnet
- `subnet` (String) The subnet which is routed via this static route and should be specified in CIDR notation (ex. 1.2.3.0/24)

Optional:

- `advertise_via_ospf_enabled` (Boolean) Option to advertise static route via OSPF
- `name` (String) Name or description for layer 3 static route
- `prefer_over_ospf_routes_enabled` (Boolean) Option to prefer static route over OSPF routes
- `vrf_leak_route_to_default_vrf` (Boolean) Whether or not next-hop IP is reachable via default VRF
- `vrf_name` (String) The name of the VRF this static route belongs to

Read-Only:

- `id` (String) The id of the item

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

In Terraform v1.12.0 and later, the [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) can be used with the `identity` attribute, for example:

```terraform
import {
  to = meraki_switch_stack_routing_static_routes.example
  identity = {
    "organization_id" : "<organization_id>"
    "network_id" : "<network_id>"
    "switch_stack_id" : "<switch_stack_id>"
  }
}
```

### Identity Schema

#### Required

- `network_id` (String) Network ID
- `organization_id` (String)
- `switch_stack_id` (String) Switch stack ID

#### Optional

- `item_ids` (List of String) List of item IDs

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, the [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) can be used with the `id` attribute, for example:

```terraform
import {
  to = meraki_switch_stack_routing_static_routes.example
  id = "<organization_id>,<network_id>,<switch_stack_id>"
}
```

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:

```shell
terraform import meraki_switch_stack_routing_static_routes.example "<organization_id>,<network_id>,<switch_stack_id>"
```

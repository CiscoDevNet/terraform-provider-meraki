# Meraki Provider

The Meraki provider provides resources to interact with a Cisco Meraki Dashboard. It communicates with Meraki Dashboard via the REST API.

All resources and data sources have been tested with the following API releases.

| API | Version |
| ---------------- | ------- |
| Meraki Dashboard | 1.63.0  |

## Getting Started

The following guides with examples exist to demonstrate the use of the provider:

- [Getting Started](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/CiscoDevNet/meraki/latest/docs/guides/getting_started)
- [Bulk Resources](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/CiscoDevNet/meraki/latest/docs/guides/bulk_resources)

## Bulk Resources

The provider includes bulk resources designed to manage multiple objects of the same type within a single resource block. Bulk resources leverage Meraki's Action Batches API to significantly reduce the number of API calls required for large-scale operations, helping avoid rate limits. For detailed information and examples, see the [Bulk Resources guide](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/CiscoDevNet/meraki/latest/docs/guides/bulk_resources).
